# network-loadbalancer-for-application-loadbalance (NLB-for-ALB)
As you all know ALB didn't provide a static IP address. So if your application required an Application Loadbalancer with Static IP address, you can follow and reffer my Terraform files.
In here I configured an NLB infront of ALB inorder to get Static IP address. I used Terraform to setup this infra in AWS.
